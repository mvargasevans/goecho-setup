# goecho-setup

This is a simple implementation of the Echo framework to build a web server in Golang. The aim of the 
project is to provide a ready-to-go starting point for newcomers or for future implementations
of the Echo server.

A Dockerfile is provided in order to spin-up the application. In case cross-compilation is needed,
a couple of parameters can be changed in the Dockerfile to match your architecture.

# Installation

Clone the directory and use `go build` to compile.
